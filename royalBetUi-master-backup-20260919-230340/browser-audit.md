# Browser Audit Findings

The live My Browser preview opens at the published nexBet domain. The home page renders the blue header, sport strip, left popular rail, hero, odds table, live section, betslip, mini-games, winners, and footer. Visible controls include the utility links, logo, primary nav, search button, Log in, Join now, sport strip links, sidebar links, hero CTAs, date/more buttons, betslip browse link, and mini-game links.

The Join now control successfully navigated to `/register`. The registration page renders the shared header and sport strip plus a centered JOIN NEXBET heading and centered registration card with Full name, Phone number, Create password, and Create account controls. The browser overlay annotates controls but does not indicate a route failure.

The current visual system is still mostly flat: white panels, light gray page background, blue header, dark live panel, and square cards. The next visual pass should add restrained clay depth and glass translucency to panels/cards without obscuring text or reducing the SportyBet palette contrast. Header spacing and button affordances should remain compact and readable.

The top GHS 0.00 balance control successfully navigated to `/wallet`. The wallet page renders deposit, withdraw, recent transactions, and wallet controls as visible interactive destinations/actions. The current live browser overlay confirms the route and control discovery; no navigation failure occurred.

The My Account utility control successfully navigated to `/account`, which renders an Account centre page with a working Sign in link. The Help centre utility control successfully navigated to `/help`, which renders support content and an Open account support link. Both routes loaded without a navigation error in My Browser.

The Bet history control successfully navigated to `/bets`, rendering the betting-history page with a Browse matches link. The Casino navigation control successfully navigated to `/casino`, rendering the casino hero, filter buttons, search input, and many game tiles with Play now links. The casino lobby is long and asset-rich; its tile links are visible and route-ready.

The updated development preview now shows rounded clay-glass panel surfaces, translucent sport strip treatment, deeper hero and card shadows, rounded odds/buttons, and a more dimensional account/card language while retaining the blue, white, charcoal, and green palette. The home page still exposes the full control set. The casino slug helper was fixed after browser testing revealed that Flip da' Coin generated an apostrophe-containing route; future game links now sanitize punctuation consistently.

In the updated dev preview, the casino tile index changed after the viewport scrolled; clicking the current first tile index 18 successfully navigated to `/games/flip-da-coin`. The game detail page rendered the exact Flip Da' Coin artwork and title, proving the sanitized slug fix works. The earlier click at a stale index did not navigate, which is expected when browser element indices change after scroll/re-render.

The updated login route now renders the WELCOME BACK heading and auth card centered in the viewport, with the clay-glass white panel, inset dark inputs, blue action button, and shared header/footer. This corrected the major horizontal shift shown in the supplied screenshot. The game-detail Log in to play control also successfully navigated to `/login`.

The primary Live navigation successfully opened `/live`. A live odds button for Fiorentina v Benevento was clicked in My Browser and the betslip updated from 0 to 1, showing the selected market, odds, potential return, Clear all, stake input, and Place bet controls. This confirms the primary betting interaction is functional in the updated preview.

## Odds contrast and selection verification
The connected browser verified that live odds now display readable light text on green panels. Selecting the first live odd changed the button to the selected visual state and updated the betslip count from 0 to 1 with the selected match and odd. The betslip also exposed Clear all, stake, and Place bet controls.

## 2026-08-16 continuation verification

- Opened `/casino` in the connected browser; Royalbet header, casino hero, category buttons, search input, and game tiles rendered.
- Clicked the `Crash` category; the visible game list narrowed to Aviator entries only, confirming the filter state and content update are functional.
- The mobile full-page preview confirmed `/`, `/casino`, `/games/aviator`, and `/live` render without blank lower sections; the mobile betslip and winners modules remain in normal flow.
- Restored and validated `GameRoute` and `SimplePage` after the casino component repair; TypeScript and production build both pass.
- Added a primary-navigation click handler that removes `menu-open`, so selecting a mobile nav destination closes the expanded menu.

## 2026-08-16 mobile sport-strip verification

- At mobile width, the primary sport strip now shows only Football, vFootball, Basketball, and a clearly labeled MORE SPORTS control, eliminating clipped Tennis/Table Tennis labels.
- Connected-browser interaction confirmed that MORE SPORTS expands the strip to show Tennis, eFootball, Table Tennis, and eBasketball, while changing the control to HIDE SPORTS with an upward chevron.
- TypeScript and production build checks pass after the sport-strip implementation.
